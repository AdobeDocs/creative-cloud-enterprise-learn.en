# UX of a project

Learn how to navigate the workspace in Adobe Express. The workspace includes powerful search capabilities for finding backgrounds, audio templates, and photos. You can access your own brands and templates, and search for specific themes. Media can be uploaded from devices or chosen from the Adobe Stock Collection. Design assets, backgrounds, shapes, and icons are available for use in projects. In addition, you can invite colleagues to collaborate on project designs.
