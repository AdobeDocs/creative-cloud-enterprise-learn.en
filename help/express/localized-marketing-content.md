# Empower distributed teams to localize content

Learn how distributed field marketing teams can easily customize content to their region for local marketing campaigns. In this workflow, the global marketing team creates brand assets and publishes content as [templates](create-templates.md) in Adobe Express. A field marketer uses Adobe Express to access campaign assets and adapts their designs to the region's needs. Other regional teams then start new Express projects from on-brand templates for new flyers, web banners, and other content.

This tutorial uses the new [Adobe Express](https://www.adobe.com/express/).
